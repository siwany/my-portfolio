I'm really proud to say that I’ve finally (and successfully!) launched my very first portfolio website. 
I built it using **Next.js** and [Once-UI](https://once-ui.com/).
On this blog, I plan to share the journey behind the projects I build, along with things I learn along the way.
I’ll also be posting personal reflections-whether it’s thoughts on a book I just read, a piece of tech news, or an article that left a strong impression.
More than anything, I hope this blog becomes a space where I can freely share my honest thoughts.

## How & Why I Built This Website

The reason I started planning and building this site was actually pretty simple:
I wanted a more visually appealing way to showcase my projects—something I could confidently send to companies so they could get to know me better and more easily.

So I went down the rabbit hole, searching for the perfect UI.
I scrolled through countless templates hoping something would click, but all I got was a headache and zero inspiration.
I even tried building everything from scratch because nothing felt quite right. It was exhausting but also a fulfilling experience that helped me understand how web apps actually work. Definitely worth the try.
Just when I was about to give up, I came across [Magic Portfolio](https://github.com/once-ui-system/magic-portfolio), and instantly loved it.
The design was clean and minimal, with just the right amount of animation (It was neither too flashy, nor too plain)

Even better, the code was intuitive and easy to customize. The built-in Once-UI components were simple, clean, and super flexible. Everything just worked.

I don’t plan on stopping here. I want to keep learning more about web development and design, and keep adding cool features along the way.

## Technologies I'm currently Into

Lately, I’ve been really into a technology called RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and building projects that integrate LLMs in meaningful ways.
These days, it feels like almost every project touches AI, but what excites me most is creating unique and useful chatbots.

As I’ve worked on chatbot projects and fine-tuned LLMs, I’ve gotten more curious about how these models are trained, how embedding models generate vectors from chunked metadata, and what makes some models more effective than others.
I’ve also realized how crucial chunking and data structuring are for building efficient and reliable bots.

That curiosity naturally led me to dive into research papers (especially those on embedding models and their efficiency) and I’ve found myself increasingly drawn to the research side of things.

I’m not exactly sure what kind of developer or researcher I’ll become, but for now, I’m excited to keep exploring and see where this path takes me.

## What I'll Be Writing About

I think I’ll write not just about tech and projects, but also personal reflections—like why and how I got into computational linguistics. (Kind of like my college essay, but hopefully way more fun.)
It’s all part of figuring out my long-term goals and what really excites me about this field.

This blog will be a space where I share my thoughts, research, and the technologies I’m exploring, while continuing to grow and build new projects along the way.
Can’t wait to see where it goes!
