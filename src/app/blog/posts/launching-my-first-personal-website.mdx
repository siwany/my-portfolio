I'm really proud to say that I’ve finally (and successfully!) launched my very first portfolio website. 
I built it using **Next.js** and a [Once-UI](https://once-ui.com/).
On this blog, I plan to share the journey behind the projects I create, from the initial idea to how I actually bring them to life.
I’ll also use this space to jot down new things I learn along the way.
From time to time, I might post personal reflections, like thoughts from books I’ve read or things that left a strong impression on me.
More than anything, I hope this blog becomes a place where I can freely share my honest thoughts.

## How & Why I Built This Website

The reason I started planning and building this site was actually pretty simple.
I just wanted a more visually appealing way to show off my projects—especially something I could confidently send to companies so that I could get a job.
So I went down the rabbit hole, hunting for the perfect UI. 
I scrolled through countless templates, hoping something would click with me but all I got was a headache and zero inspiration.
Right when I was about to give up, I stumbled across [Magic Portfolio](https://github.com/once-ui-system/magic-portfolio), and I instantly fell in love with the template. 
It was the first time a UI really clicked with me. The design is clean and minimal, and the animations strike the perfect balance. It was not too flashy, but not too plain either.

Even better, the file structure was super intuitive, which made customizing everything feel way less intimidating.
The built-in Once-UI components were simple, clean, and surprisingly flexible. Everything just worked.
And honestly, I don’t plan on stopping here. I want to keep learning more about Web dev and design in general, and keep adding cool features as I go.
Let’s see where this takes me.

## Technologies I'm currently Into

Lately, I’ve been really into RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and building projects that integrate LLMs in meaningful ways.
These days, it feels like almost every project involves AI somehow, but I get the most excited when AI is at the core.

As I’ve worked on chatbot projects and fine-tuned LLMs, I’ve gotten more curious about how these models are trained, how embedding models generate vectors from chunked metadata, and what makes some models more effective than others.
I’ve also realized how important chunking and data structuring are when it comes to building efficient and reliable bots.

That curiosity naturally led me to read research papers—especially those focused on topics like multimodal LLMs and model efficiency—and now I’m finding myself more and more drawn to the research side of things.

I don’t know exactly what kind of developer or researcher I’ll become, but for now, I’m excited to keep exploring this path and see where it leads.

## What I'll Be Writing About

I think I’ll write not only about tech and projects, but also personal reflections like why I got into computational linguistics and what led me to explore the field more deeply as part of figuring out my long-term goals.
This blog will be a space where I share my thoughts, research, and the technologies I’m interested in, while continuing to grow and improve my projects along the way.

Thanks for following along on this blog journey.
I’m just getting started, and I can’t wait to see where it goes!
